%% Compute center and bandedge frequencies for third octave bands (TOB)
% Script taken from PAMGuide, Merchant et al., 2015, Measuring acoustic
% habitats

% Several variables like center and bandedges frequencies do not need to be
% reused in each iteration in the main script. As a consequence, all these
% variables are set once for the whole process.

% lcut should not be less than 25 Hz to avoid differences bigger than 1 dB
% compared to the standard method for TOL computations with filters (see
% the user documentation for more informations).

% This code accompanies the manuscript:

%   Merchant et al. (2015). Measuring Acoustic Habitats. Methods in Ecology
%    and Evolution

% and follows the equations presented in Appendix S1. It is not necessarily
% optimised for efficiency or concision.
